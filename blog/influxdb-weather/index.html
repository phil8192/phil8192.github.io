<p>
For ~8 years now, I've operated a personal weather station using a
Watson W-8681. The station includes a number of sensors, including wind
speed, wind direction, temperature, and humidity. Despite having to replace the
brittle anemometer twice, the station has served me well during this time. I had
used
<a href="https://github.com/jim-easterbrook">Jim Easterbrook</a>'s excellent
<a href="https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pywws">pywws</a> package to extract
data from the unit's USB interface, push readings to Met Office
<a href="http://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/">"wow"</a> and
<a href="https://www.wunderground.com/">Weather Underground</a>. I had also
modified pywws, adding the ability to push weather updates to a
<a href="https://pusher.com/">pusher channel</a> from which I had based a
basic web-socket weather status page on. I used this in combination with the
gnuplot output from pywws as a personal/local weather dashboard.
</p>

<p>
This configuration worked well for many years until eventually the external
transmitter failed. Annoyingly,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maplin_(retailer)">Maplin</a> no-longer
stocked the specific transmitter, although did stock a slightly different
version operating on a *different* radio frequency. In addition, the transmitter
did not support my wind direction sensor. I could live without the wind-
direction sensor, however the different frequency was an issue. My W-8681 unit
operates on 868.3MHz, while the replacement transmitter operates on the popular
433MHz range.
(Note: Sadly, Maplin has now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/maplin-63-head-office-workers-made-redundant-administration">closed down</a>).

<p>
About the same time, I had also started to monitor my home power consumption
using an OWL-CM160 energy monitor. Like the W-8681, it is possible to extract
data from the device over a USB interface. With my broken weather station and
power monitor, I created a new weather/power monitoring dashboard based on
<a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a>.
(a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database">time series database</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Using a mix of disparate sensors, I now have a pretty good overview of the
status of my domicile. I also receive a message on my phone
(over <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> messenger) when the outside
temperature drops below freezing and for fun, whenever the kettle is used. 
</p>

<p>
My configuration is depicted in the ASCII below.

<p>
At the base of this configuration is a raspberry pi (model b) running Debian.
The pi is connected to my old W-8681 weather station via USB, from which I still
make use of pywws for reading data. To overcome the issue with different radio
frequencies, the W-8681 no longer receives input from the external transmitter.
Instead, the pi receives the signal directly via
<a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/">software defined radio</a> over a USB TV
dongle. In addition, the pi receives power consumption data via USB from the
CM-160.
</p>

<img src="pi_weather.png" alt="pi weather station"/>

<p>
The nice thing about this configuration (for me at least) is that it makes use
of otherwise depreciated components and abstracts away hardware specific bits
and pieces. The time series database/the endpoint I push to, is agnostic to the
source of the data: Everything is a sensor. 
</p>


<h2 id="433mhz">Weather sensors</h2>

<p>
I have 2 n25fr temperature+humidity sensors. The sensor outside is also attached
to a anemometer and rain gauge. The indoor sensor is located in my living room.
</p>

<p>
Both of these sensors were designed to transmit data to an n25fr (WH1050)
weather base station which I do not have. Instead, I intercept the sensor
readings using a USB TV dongle.
</p>

<img src="gqrx_01.png" alt="n25fr 433mhz - 01"/>

<p>
Every 48 seconds, the sensor transmits a burst of data containing a number of
readings. Shown above and below is a spectrogram showing the transmission from
my garden sensor on 433.861 MHz (the other transmits on a slightly different
frequency in the 433 MHz range). I used <a href="http://gqrx.dk/">gqrx</a> to
receive this. 
</p>

<img src="gqrx_02.png" alt="n25fr 433mhz - 02"/>

<p>
The transmission contains
<a href="https://www.susa.net/wordpress/2012/08/raspberry-pi-reading-wh1081-weather-sensors-using-an-rfm01-and-rfm12b/">10 bytes of information</a>
including temperature, humidity, rainfall and wind speed. I used
<a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a> to decode this info.
rtl_433 is a great project which supports decoding of over 100 devices which
operate on the 433 MHz frequency. The tool has the option to output decoded
messages as JSON objects, which I use in this setup.
</p>

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Every 48 seconds I receive an update from each of the 2 sensors in the form of
JSON data, which I then
<a href="https://github.com/phil8192/home-monitoring/blob/master/weather_n25fr.sh">pipe</a>
to a
<a href="https://github.com/phil8192/home-monitoring/blob/master/influx/influx_n25fr.py">script</a>
which in turn pushes the update (if something has changed) to my InfluxDB
instance.
</p>


<h2 id="base">Weather base station</h2>

<p>
The base station once received input from an external sensor similar to the
n25fr which used to operate on 868.3 MHz and also transmit wind direction. Since
the transmitter died, I'm left with just the base station, which currently sits
in my office to monitor temperature, humidity and record air pressure. The unit
is connected to the Raspberry PI via USB.
</p>

<p>
I had previously used
<a href="https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pywws">pywws</a> to dump data and
upload to wunderground, met office wow and my own pusherapp based dashboard.
Since the external sensor died, I have defaulted to using the output of
pywws-testweatherstation from pywws as
<a href="https://github.com/phil8192/home-monitoring/blob/master/weather_wh1080.sh">input</a>
to a script which pushes updates to InfluxDB.
</p>

<h2 id="energy">Energy monitor</h2>

<p>
The energy monitor base station is also connected to the rpi via USB. I'm using
an OWL 160 which receives power usage updates from a magnetic sensor attached to
the incoming power cable to my house (inside the power meter box). The sensor
itself also transmits on 433 MHz, but for now, I just rely on the OWL unit to
receive this signal.
</p>

<p>
To read data from the OWL unit, I use
<a href="https://github.com/cornetp/eagle-owl">eagle-owl</a>. Again, I pipe the
output of this tool to a
<a href="https://github.com/phil8192/home-monitoring/blob/master/power_cm160.sh">
script</a> which, in turn, pushes a reading to InfluxDB containing my current
electricity use in kWh.
</p>

<p>
Monitoring my home power usage has been pretty useful for me. Since doing this,
I've reduced my power draw significantly. Starting with my computers, I use the
most optimal PSU for my load possible, I only use LED lights etc. Being aware of
power consumption trend is more useful than real time kWh alone. Although not
terribly exciting, I have also been able to diagnose a failing refrigerator
compressor quickly using this data. This was detected from an abnormal step-
pattern in kWh: the compressor would usually turn on at specific intervals, and
one day began fluctuating erratically until settling into an always-on state.
This would have been quite expensive if not caught early, given the high amount
of power refrigerators draw when active.
</p>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
I have pushed some
<a href="https://github.com/phil8192/home-monitoring/">code</a> to Github which
is specific to my setup, but may be of use to anyone looking to do something
similar.
