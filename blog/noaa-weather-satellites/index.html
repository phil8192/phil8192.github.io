<h1>Receiving NOAA weather satellite images</h1>
<h3>Thu Aug  9 09:58:20 UTC 2018</h3>
</div>

<p>
Since 1960, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration">The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (<a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a>) have operated a series of weather satellites as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Operational_Environmental_Satellites">Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES)</a> programme. The programme has since ended and will be superseded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Polar_Satellite_System">Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)</a> of which the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-20">satellite</a> was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJtEGtbfJ34">launched</a> at the end of 2017.
</p>

<img src="tiros_01.jpg" alt="tiros"/>
<br/>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIROS-1">TIROS v1</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Infrared_Observation_Satellite">Television Infrared Observation Satellite</a> launched in 1960. Img src: NOAA <a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Organization/History/POES_history.html">POES history</a>)

<p>
The first POES satellite, the TIROS 1 (shown above), was intended to test the
effectiveness of satellites for remote sensing and earth observation. The
satellite was a great success, and was immediately of use in weather
forecasting. TIROS 1 captured this first (beautiful) TV image of the earth:
</p>

<img src="tiros_02.png" alt="first tv image of earth"/>
<br/>
(Img src: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Infrared_Observation_Satellite">wikipedia</a>. Original: NASA</a>)

<p>
Whilst TIROS 1 is *<a href="https://www.n2yo.com/?s=29">still</a>* hurtling
around the earth at 16848 mph, the <a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Operations/POES/status.html">current</a> POES system consists of 3
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIROS-N">TIROS-N</a> satellites:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-15">NOAA 15</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-18">18</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-19">19</a>, launched in 1998, 2005,
and 2009 respectively.
</p>

<p>
These 3 1,457 kilo satellites orbit at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis">~</a>520 miles altitude, at the
same speed of TIROS 1 (16848 mph) such that each craft completes a trip around
the circumference of the Earth in ~101 minutes: the satellites follow a
particular orbit type known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit">Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO)</a>.
The orbit guarantees that each point on the Earth will be observed at least once every 12 hours.
</p>

<p>
The satellites transmit on-board sensor data in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-resolution_picture_transmission">High-resolution picture transmission (HRPT)</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission">Automatic Picture Transmission (APT)</a>
at ~1700 MHz, ~137 MHz respectively. In the world of amateur radio and earth
observation, it is well known and quite a popular pursuit to capture and decode
APT data, and more so since the advent of <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/">RTL-SDR</a>. Since reading a number of
<a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-receiving-noaa-weather-satellite-images/">guides</a>
on how to intercept and decode the images continuously transmitted from
these satellites, I have been keen to give it a go myself.
</p>


<h2>Tracking the satellites</h2>

<p>
As mentioned before, the three NOAA satellites each make a complete orbit in
~101 minutes. In order to capture the APT transmission from a satellite, it
must first be within line of sight of the base station/receiver.
</p>

<p>
The US air-force keeps track of all orbiting objects and maintains a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set">two-line element set (TLE)</a>
for each tracked object. This format, which is described in great detail on the
<a href="https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/">celestrak</a> site,
was originally intended for punch-card machines and contains a minimal set of
parameters which can be used to derive the trajectory of an orbiting object.
The TLE data for the NOAA satellites is available from
<a href="http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/noaa.txt">celestrak</a>.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, many projects exist to decode this format.
<a href="https://github.com/pytroll/pyorbital">pyorbital</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/python-sgp4">py-sgp4</a> are some
python options,
<a href="https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js">satellite-js</a> seems like
a popular javascript implementation. A neat UI option might be
<a href="https://github.com/trehn/termtrack">termtrack</a> - a console based
satellite tracking UI and the popular and well-established
<a href="http://gpredict.oz9aec.net/">gpredict</a>, which I have used here.
</p>

<img src="gpredict.png" alt="noaa gpredict"/>

<p>
Having specified the location of a base station, gpredict will track the
location of specified satellites and calculate the precise time, location and
track of future passes with respect to the horizon to horizon view of the base
station. When a NOAA satellite passes overhead, it will be possible to receive
it's APT transmission which will be strongest when the satellite is directly
overhead and weakest as it ascends/descends from/to the horizon.
</p>

<p>
I find the "sky at a glance" feature very useful as it provides a schedule of
upcoming passes for each of the satellites I am tracking. Currently, I will
head outside to receive the transmission from time to time, although plan to
automate this later on.
</p>


<h2>Quadrifilar Helicoidal Antenna (QFH)</h2>

<p>
To receive the APT signal, it is necessary to use either a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstile_antenna">turnstile</a>
or a <a href="http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/index.en.php">QFH</a> antenna. The QFH
antenna is apparently the best option, with many <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/NOAA-Satellite-Signals-with-a-PVC-QFH-Antenna-and-/">guides</a>
on how to construct it.
</p>

<p>
I have wanted to make one of these antennas for a long time now, however found
the design quite confusing. One of the first guides I read was by the late <a href="http://www.g4ilo.com/">Julian Moss (G4ILO)</a>.
I found Julian's <a href="http://www.g4ilo.com/qfh.html">guide</a> invaluable in
understanding the wiring and eventually used <a href="http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/img/v2/012.jpeg">this</a>
design along with the default settings for <a href="http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/calc.en.php">this</a> QFH calculator.
</p>

<img alt="QFH antenna - 01" src="qfh_antenna_01.jpg"/>

<p>
Most guides make use of PVC piping to construct the frame. After some
experimentation, I managed to make a frame using a few garden canes cut to the
dimensions specified by the <a href="http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/calc.en.php">QFH calculator</a>
along with lots of cable zip ties. For the antenna, I have made use of 50 ohm
coaxial cable, as per the G4ILO guide.
</p>

<img alt="QFH antenna - 02" src="qfh_antenna_02.jpg"/>

<p>
The resulting antenna, shown above attached to my bike work stand is
surprisingly stable, despite being made from cane. It has the added bonus of
being a little more environmentally friendly than the PVC version :)
Construction of the antenna has been one of the most enjoyable parts of the 
project for me. 
</p>



<h2>Receiving the signal</h2>

<p>
The NOAA satellites transmit Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) on the
following frequencies:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td>NOAA 15</td><td>137.62 MHz</td></tr>
  <tr><td>NOAA 18</td><td>137.9125 MHz</td></tr>
  <tr><td>NOAA 19</td><td>137.1 MHz</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
I am using <a href="http://gqrx.dk/">Gqrx SDR</a> in combination with a cheap
RTL2832U USB TV dongle attached to my QFH antenna to record the NOAA APT
transmissions. To capture one of the signals, I first wait until one of the
satellites enters range with Gpredict, then record the transmission
for as long as possible as the satellite passes from horizon to horizon.
</p>

<img src="noaa_19_2018-07-13_15_30.png" alt="gqrx noaa 18"/>

<p>
The APT data, which is transmitted as an audible FM signal is an interesting
format. The <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Automatic_Picture_Transmission_(APT)">Signal identification guide</a>
site describes the format in lots of detail as does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission">wikipedia</a>
page. Briefly, the transmission consists of a pair of 4km per pixel 8-bit images,
synchronisation and telemetry data. The images are obtained from an advanced
very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensor, one of which is long-wave 
infrared and the other mid-wave infrared or near-visible if the satellite is in
daylight.
</p>

<img src="APT_format.png" alt="APT protocol"/>
<br/>
(Img src: <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Automatic_Picture_Transmission_(APT)">Signal identification wiki</a>)

<p>
The image (which contains both infrared, visible and sychronisation data) is
transmitted at a rate of 2 lines per second. Each line is 2080 pixels containing
2*909 image pixels and 262 pixels of synchronisation data.
</p>

<img src="doppler.png" alt="gqrx noaa doppler shift"/>

<p>
As the satellite travels overhead, the signal drifts, exhibiting a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">doppler shift</a>
as shown above for a NOAA 19 pass. The actual signal sounds like this:
</p>

<audio controls loop>
  <source src="noaa_19.wav" type="audio/wav">
  :/ your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<p>
Having recorded the pass using Gqrx, the next step is to convert the audible
signal into an image. I hope to write my own code to do this at some point, but
for now, have made use of <a href="https://wxtoimgrestored.xyz/">WXtoImg</a>.
WXtoImg takes as input a .wav containing the APT signal and outputs the raw
greyscale image data, false colour images and can even overlay a cloud-cover
heatmap indicating precipitation probability derived from a multispectral
analysis,
</p>


<h2>NOAA 15</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-15">NOAA 15</a> is the oldest of the
operational NOAA satellites, launched on 1998-05-13.
</p>

<img alt="noaa 15 - 01" src="NOAA-M-01.jpg"/>
<br/>
(Img src: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-15">Wikipedia</a> original src dead. Also, I think this is NOAA 17)

<p>
In the 1960s, TIROS v1 made
a significant impact on weather forecasting capability. Later, toward the end of
the 1990s, NOAA 15, with it's microwave sounding unit capable of detecting
temperature and humidity, significantly improved forecasting capability,
especially in the
<a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/news/2018/noaa-satellite-launch-20-years-ago-marked-start-new-era">southern hemisphere</a>
where there were fewer weather observations.
</p>

<br/>
(Img src: <a href="https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/864148496697483264">NOAA/twitter</a>)


<p>
So far, I have captured a couple of images from NOAA 15, shown below. The first
shows the raw image format described by the APT protocol: 2 909 pixel wide 
images along with synchronisation and telemetry data in the left and right
margins.
</p>

<img alt="noaa 15 apt - 01" src="noaa_15_01.jpg"/>
<br/>
(2018-07-03)

<p>
The image on the left is from the infrared sensor and has been post-processed
with the wxtoimg tool to show precipitation probability. The right hand side
image is from the near-visible sensor and has been artificially coloured.
</p>

<img alt="noaa 15 apt - 02" src="noaa_15_02.jpg"/>
<br/>
(2018-07-01)

<p>
The image above shows a raw greyscale image with no post-processing. I captured
this image with an earlier attempt at the QFH antenna: notice the substantial
noise and signal drop-outs. The drop-outs are actually due to poor wire
connectivity and me moving around a bit while recording the signal.
</p>



<h2>NOAA 18</h2>

<p>
After NOAA 15, there was NOAA 16 + 17. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-17">NOAA 17</a>
was decommissioned in 2013, whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-16">NOAA 16</a>, after
a critical failure was decommissioned in 2014. NOAA 16 has since broken up, and now consists of 275
individually tracked objects! (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-16">wikipedia</a> article.
</p>
 

<img alt="NOAA 18 - 01" src="noaa_18_01.jpg"/>
<br/>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-18">NOAA 18</a> is thus the next
(operational) satellite in the series. It was launched on 20-05-2005. Note that
the NOAA craft all have their own QFH antenna, clearly visible in this image of NOAA 18:

<p>
The following image is by far the most interesting image I have captured from
NOAA 18 so far. It shows a clear view of the Bay of Biscay and edge of the
Mediterranean sea. The noise at the top and bottom of the image is due to
buildings and hills on my horizon. Open the image in a new tab for a higher
resolution view.
</p>

<img alt="noaa 18 apt - 01" src="noaa_18_01_apt.jpg"/>
<br/>
(2018-07-09 08:53 UTC)

<p>
In the following image, (I think) the wavelength of the sensor has been
switched part way through image capture as the satellite enters a nocturnal
orbit.
</p>

<img alt="noaa 18 apt - 02" src="noaa_18_02_apt.jpg"/>
<br/>
(2018-07-04)

<p>
The following is the first image I managed to receive using an early version of
the QFH antenna. The image was received at sunset which emphasises cloud
features. Whilst not a particularly interesting image, it was a nice moment when
decoded.
</p>

<h2>NOAA 19</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-19">NOAA 19</a> was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2axIyPPk7Jg">launched</a>
2009-02-06 and is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxhlfBLS8rg">last</a> satellite in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Operational_Environmental_Satellites">POES</a>
programme.

<p>
During manufacture, the satellite detached from it's base which caused $135 million
in damage. Oops. More info on the Wikipedia page and the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/65776main_noaa_np_mishap.pdf">official NASA report</a>.
</p>

<br/>
(Image: NASA. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-19">src</a>)

<p>
I have captured a few images from NOAA 19. This is the most recent one:
</p>

<img alt="noaa 19 apt - july 2018" src="noaa_19_31_jul.jpg"/>
<br/>
(2018-07-31 15:36 UTC)

<p>
The image below is my favourite so far - open the image in a new tab for a higher resolution
view. It shows a reflection of the sun in the North Atlantic Ocean, central
Europe and even the Strait of Gibraltar in the noisy part of the image.
</p>

<img alt="noaa 19 apt - 01" src="noaa_19_01.jpg"/>
<br/>
(2018-07-13 15:30 UTC)

<p>
This final image shows the UK, Norway and Sweden quite well. It was taken during
a recent spell of warm weather - much of the UK is cloud free.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
I plan to automate this whole process and combine the weather satellite images
with data from my <a href="http://parasec.net/blog/influxdb-weather/">weather station</a>.
For now, it is quite fun to go out into the garden once in a while to capture an
instantaneous image as a satellite passes overhead. I'm planning to record some
passes from the peak of a local (&gt; 300m) hill which I hope will be free of the noise
near the horizon in my current images. 
</p>

<p>
When I have automated this process, I plan to try and receive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-resolution_picture_transmission">High-resolution picture transmission (HRPTs)</a>
from the same series of satellites.
