<h1>Kaggle - Santa's Workshop Tour 2019</h1>

<p>
This Xmas I took part in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/">Kaggle - Santa's Workshop Tour 2019</a>
competition. Last year, I managed to get a bronze, code+blog <a href="http://parasec.net/blog/kaggle-traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
As with the previous year, this was an optimisation problem. Without going into too much detail, the problem was to assign 5000 families to to a daily schedule, where each family had expressed a set of preferences for 10 different days to visit Santa's workshop 100 days before xmas. Each day was (hard) constrained to hold a minimum of 125 to a maximum of 300 people. The objective was to minimise a score which penalised solutions where family preferences were not met + an accounting fee which favoured a smooth assignment (in terms of first differences) of families over the 100 days.
</p>

<p>
Unlike last year, early in the competition, it became apparent that an optimal solution had been found - A few entries with the same score at top of leader-board.
</p>
<p>
It turned out that that problem could be solved (proved to optimality) by formulating it as a Linear Programming problem. I've done some linear programming in the past, and had a go myself. The sheer number of variables involved was too much for an open source solver (CBC or GLPK). It could only be solved using a commercial solver such as CPLEX or Gurobi). I've used Gurobi in the past, it really is exceptional. The problem is, it is very expensive (10k+). They also offer a free license to academics, so the leader-board quickly became populated with optimal scores from people lucky enough to have access to Gurobi or another commercial solver. It was not a trivial problem to model (it was actually pretty hard, requiring integer linear programming skill). However, the competition was somewhat tainted by this.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, I tried to compete with heuristics :). - I want this damn medal!
</p>

<h3>Approach #1 - Random moves &amp; hill-climbing</h3>
<p>
The first approach I took was to randomly select a single family, and then randomly select a day to move them to from their stated preferences. The move to a new day was only considered if the hard-constraints (min 125, max 300) for the current and candidate day were satisfied. If the candidate assignment yielded a better score, the candidate solution was accepted and a new random family was tried. This continued until I hit control-c. 
</p>

<p>
This worked quite well initially. I was able to get a reasonable score and could leave it running, checking in once and a while. It soon became apparent that the move operation is quite limited, so I extended it to include family swaps, where 2 families are selected, and if possible, they exchange assigned days (constraints permitting).
</p>

<p>
By just following this simple heuristic, I was able to stay above the scores from the public kernels. However, as with last year, higher quality public approaches/kernels began to appear, so I had to think of some new approaches.

<h3>Approach #2 - Brute force using optimised objective function</h3>
<p>
The previous approach got stuck in local-minima pretty fast. I wanted to know for sure if I was
stuck in local-minima. The problem was that the objective function was quite computationally expensive to compute, requiring iteration over all families for both the assignment and accounting penalty score.
</p>

<p>
After lots of prototyping, I found a way to compute the objective function for a candidate move *very* quickly, using a move delta for both components of the score. This allowed me to assess new moves extremely fast, opening up lots of different possibilities in terms of algorithm implementation.
</p>

<p>
Working from the first approach, I brute forced all possible moves from 1-2 families. When a move was found, the algorithm started from the first family. Upon reaching the final family, if no moves could be found, then the algorithm returned a local-minimum solution.
</p>

<p>
It was possible to brute force all 1-2 family combinations in a few seconds using my fast penalty function. The computation time for all combinations of 3-family moves was significantly higher. To do this, I split the combinations to be considered into a random list and placed each unit of work onto a blocking-queue. I then had a set of "brute worker" threads consume from this queue, placing candidate solutions onto a different incoming-solution-queue. A supervisor thread would restart all workers and randomise the combination queue upon receiving an improvement in score.
</p>

<h3>Approach #3 - Simulated Annealing</h3>

<p>
To escape the local minima, I implemented simulating-annealing with a move selection probability function which favoured less-damaging moves (in terms of objective function delta).
</p>

<p>
As with the previous approach, I used multiple simulated-annealing workers, each initialised with a randomly seeded random-number-generator.
</p>

<h3>Approach #4</h3>

<p>
The final algorithm was a mix of hill climbing with random moves, brute force and simulated annealing executed concurrently.
</p>

<p>
In the final few days of the competition I fired up an Amazon EC2 c5-metal spot-instance with 96 cores (Xeon - Cascade Lake). With these heuristics, and a bit of help all these cores, was able to stay in the leader-board.
</p>

<h3>End result</h3>
<p>
In the end, I ended up at position <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/edgecrusher">114</a> out of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/leaderboard">1620</a> - another bronze :) I'm quite happy with that, given that my approach was 100% based on heuristics :]
